                    <td>Background: lndia has emerged as leading milk producer country in the world, however productivity of dairy animals is very low. To improve the productivity of animals a major focus area is to breed these animals using semen from high genetic merit bulls through Artificial lnsemination (Al). Al enables farmers to access the best bull (male) genetics. Farmers can improve the production, health traits, fertility and longevity of their dairy cattle by using a balanced approach to breeding. Animal health is also improved through the use of Al.
        Description: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery
        system in lndia.
        Semen doses are currently stored and transported using liquid nitrogen and specialized containers. However, significant losses of liquid nitrogen occur during storage and transportation, leading to escalated costs for maintaining the cold chain. The cost of liquid nitrogen itself is an issue. Mishandling of liquid nitrogen poses potential health hazards. The bulky and heavy nature of liquid nitrogen storage containers necessitates considerable resou rces for transportation.
        Expected solution:
        . There is a need to explore and promote alternative, cost-effective, and long-lasting methods for the storage and transportation of semen doses
        . The design, material, type of insulation of storage containers can also help in cost effectiveness, reduction in losses, compactness and ease of carrying to facilitate efficient distribution.</td>

                    <td>Background: Dual use precursor chemicals are substances that have legitimate industrial and commercial applications but can also be used in the illicit manufacture of drugs. For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.
        Description: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances)

Using this continuous spectral information classification of diverse material of interest can be done accurately. The availability of huge information due to continuous spectral information improves data information content but causing challenges in processing of hyperspectral images. An unsupervised learning mechanism for detection of targets by optimizing Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Image Processing using AI/ML can be used for it.
        Description: The above problem statement envisages, that Hyperspectral data to be processed in such a way that to find spectrally distinct and most informative pixels in the data to identify anomalies in the data. Before processing of data, data correction methods, to improve interpretation of pixel spectra and better result to analyse data can be done.

Judicious use of fresh water which will result in less generation of a minimum quantity of grey water) Reuse (Le. reuse of grey water for Kitchen garden, and treated water for irrigating crops, toilet flushing, vehicle washing etc.) and Recharge (i.e. adoption of technologies such as soakage pit and leach pit).
        Greywater Management is encouraged to be implemented as close to source as possible to reduce cost and complexity. Preferably, greywater should be managed at the household level, with community-level management as a secondary option, and management at the Drain End Point considered only as a last resort.

        Green hydrogen, produced from renewable energy sources, offers a game-changing solution for decarbonization. Unlike its fossil fuel counterpart, green hydrogen emits no greenhouse gasses at the point of use, making it ideal for hard-to-electrify sectors like heavy industry, long-distance transport, and steel production. This clean fuel can power vehicles and industrial processes, slashing emissions and combating climate change. Furthermore, green hydrogen's potential for energy storage allows for a more balanced and resilient renewable energy grid. As we strive for a net-zero future, green hydrogen is a crucial tool for a cleaner and more sustainable tomorrow.
        
        Description:
        Green hydrogen's potential for clean energy is undeniable. However, its widespread adoption faces a significant roadblock: high levelized cost. This cost, encompassing production, storage, and transportation, makes green hydrogen less competitive compared to traditional fossil fuels. This disparity discourages industries from switching to green alternatives. Government incentives, technological advancements, and economies of scale are all crucial to bridge this cost gap. Only then can green hydrogen fulfil its promise as a transformative force in the fight against climate change.

        Management of solid waste has been one of the key problem in most of the cities around the world. The failure is evident from burgeoning growth of landfill site into mountain of MSW. Waste management accounts for a comparatively very high share of national GHG emissions in several countries worldwide. Emissions of methane following the disposal of waste in landfill account for a large share of GHG emissions from waste management.
        
        Description:
        With increasing pressure of development and urbanization, the need for efficient municipal service delivery is also growing rapidly, which the municipal bodies are very often unable to cope with. This is true in case of solid waste disposal and management as well. The main objectives of solid waste management are to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, promote recycling, and minimize the negative effects of waste on the environment and human health

        Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost.
        
        Description:
        Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5°C goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.

        Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is
        the bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons.
        Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods.
        Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.</td>

                    <td>Background: As per the census 2011, Disability is more common in elderly people. One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as “unexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,” are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility
        Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more
        The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people.
        Expected Solution:
        These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers</td>

Functional body powered upper limb prosthesis can replace the functions of upper limb for ADL activities up to some extent. But in higher level of upper limb amputation, it becomes difficult for the patient to manage ADL activities. The requirement of externally powered prosthesis such as myoelectric prosthesis plays a vital role in this aspect.
        Description of Problem statement: 
        A myoelectric prosthesis is an externally powered prosthesis which is controlled by muscle contraction (muscle action potential). In market, many variants of myoelectric prostheses are available with various features. The most important feature of these prostheses is the grasping pattern types and also it indicates about movement of different fingers in prosthesis.

As a result of this water flows from such well automatically and pumping devices are not required. Such autoflow wells are observed mostly in the Terai region of India. As shown by the aquifer mapping studies, the extents of autoflow areas are shrinking in parts of Uttarakhand and elsewhere. 
        Many private wells in these terrains are without any cap or tap and water flows continuously leading to huge groundwater losses. 
        Further, measurement of head (water level) in these wells is a challenge as water flows automatically from these wells. Usually an additional pipe is attached above the ground level and the water level in such a pipes is measured manually. 
        The proposal is to develop a device that can serve two purposes- i) it will work as a safe cap for the well with a tap for regulating water flow and ii) a pressure transducer based sensor that can sense the pressure and translate it in terms of height (in m) above ground level</td>

        The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind presents significant challenges due to their intermittent nature. This variability can strain the power grid, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues. Traditional grid infrastructure is not designed to handle these fluctuations effectively, resulting in energy wastage and a reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power. Energy storage systems (ESS) offer a potential solution by storing excess energy generated during peak production periods and releasing it during times of high demand or low generation, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.
        
        Description:
        The task is to design an innovative and efficient energy storage system to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources and stabilize the grid. This requires addressing several key challenges: high costs, technological limitations, and regulatory barriers. Current ESS technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, pumped hydro storage, and flow batteries, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Innovative ideas need to be explored to reduce costs, enhance storage capacities, and improve the efficiency and lifespan of these technologies. Additionally, how to navigate and potentially reform regulatory frameworks to support the widespread adoption of ESS may also be explored.

The disposal of this ash presents significant environmental challenges, such as land degradation, groundwater contamination, and air pollution. Traditional disposal methods like landfilling or Ash dykes are not only unsustainable but also lead to challenges in ecological restoration. Despite the potential for beneficial use in various industries, a large portion of ash remains underutilized.
        
        Description:
        Current methods for managing and disposing of ash from power plants are inadequate and environmentally detrimental. The accumulation of ash in landfills poses serious environmental risks, including soil and water pollution. Additionally, these disposal methods fail to leverage the potential value of ash in other applications.

Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). 
        However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. 
        Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. 
        Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. 
        These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.</td>

                    <td>Tyre cost is one of the most important O&M cost in dumpers. In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each.
        Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important.
        TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour
        It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation.
        TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour)
        Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift.
        Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory.
        More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must.
        Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition.
        Tyre Pressure
        Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources.
        Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime.
        Tyre Performance Analysis
        Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres.
        Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.</td>

        ln Science Museums/ Centres exhibits are mostly interactive in nature. Interactive exhibits are the lifeblood of science centers, but keeping them functioning smoothly can be a challenge. It poses the problem of regular maintenance. It has also been observed that defects remain unattended for long due to not being identified. It creates a genuine problem for the visitors' experience and sometimes they are not aware of the optimum result. Here lines the requirement for an automated defective exhibit identification system.
        Description:
        It is a real-life problem in big Museum/ Science Museum/Centres, where there is inadequacy of manpower. Following are the problems in a nutshell that arose due to unnoticed and undiagnosed defects of the exhibits.
        High Maintenance Needs: Unlike static displays, interactive elements have more moving parts, software, and technology that require regular upkeep to function properly these are considered as ""golden parameters of any particular Exhibits"". Theses parameters are to be kept functional to keep the exhibits in a running condition.
        Frustration for Visitors: Encountering a non-functional exhibit can be frustrating for visitors, especially children, who may not understand why it's not working.
        Missed Learning Opportunities: Broken/ non-functional exhibits prevent visitors from fully engaging with the science concepts they're designed to teach.
        Because of their complexity, malfunctions might not be immediately obvious to visitors or staff, leading to a broken experience. Also creates a bad impression for that particular gallery and ultimately to the science center or to Science Museums.
        Expected Solution:
        Now, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, it transpires that amalgamation of Al with automation may give efficient result to detect defective exhibits placed in the galleries and give the feedback to the concerned section for immediate repairing initiative and rectify the exhibits.

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.
        Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:
        60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam
        40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam
        30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.
        Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.

The change output should be in the form of polygons in a geographically referenced vector file. The solution should be scalable, means should be able to run on huge areas of interest and generate change alerts. The criteria for winning solution would be minimum false alarms with regard to man made changes.

These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.
        Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.
        Detailed Description:
        Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.
        A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.
        Expected Solution:
        Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird

                    <td>Background:
        The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.
        Description:
        The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.
        Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.
        Expected Solution:
        An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.</td>

        Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life.
        Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.
        This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.
        Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. 
        Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. 
        Possible Solution:
        An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.
        Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.</td>

        Visitors to museums often face several significant challenges due to manual ticket booking systems. One prominent issue is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. Long queues are common, especially during peak hours, weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance, double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers.
        Description:

                    <td>Background:
        Many organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic.
        Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks.
        
        • Description:
        The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further
        investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.
        Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:
        1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range
        2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version
        3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint
        4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)
        There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.
        For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:
        1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.
        2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).
        3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).
        4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.
        5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.
        A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.
        
        Expected Solution:
        A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools
        should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.</td>

Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. 
        Detailed description: 
        The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. 
        To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.

        A software/tool/system to be developed for detecting oil spills/vessel in distress with suitable methodology that involves programming in python. The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.</td>

                    <td>Background:
        INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.
        Detailed Description:
        Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. 
        Data input, classification and arrangement 
        The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.
        Users, Data output and visualization
        The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.
        -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.
        Data Accessibility
        The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.
        Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.</td>

                    <td>Background: Most of the goods are transported around the world by shipping which relies heavily on fossil fuels for powering. Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.
        Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

                    <td>Background: In an institute environment, multiple users often require access to the same datasets for various purposes. However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.
        Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.
        The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.
        If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.
        This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.
        Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.</td>

To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).
        
        Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.
        
        Expected Solution:
        The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.

        In today's digital age, the ability to efficiently manage documents is crucial for organizations. However, a significant challenge arises when dealing with non-machine-readable documents such as PDFs or Word documents. These formats hinder automation and make it difficult to extract meaningful insights from the data they contain. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a solution that can both restrict the ingestion of non-machine-readable documents and facilitate the creation of machine-readable documents seamlessly.
        Description:
        The above problem statement envisages:
        1. To develop an application that can restrict software applications from ingesting any non-machine-readable document format such as PDFs, DOCs, or any other document types.
        2. To create a mechanism within the application to generate machine-readable documents automatically whenever a new document is created, regardless of its source - scanned, generated through a software application, or otherwise.
        Expected Solution:
        The TransformoDocs application aims to address the challenges associated with managing non-machine-readable documents by developing a comprehensive document transformation application. It will help in realizing the benefits of search-ability, artificial intelligence, accessibility to persons with disability, machine translation and access to data across applications and data exchanges. This application may offer efficient data extraction, standardized processing, workflow automation, data quality improvement, scalability, integration with external systems, advanced analytics, and compliance with regulatory requirements ultimately unlocking the value of their data.</td>

        Authentication in the browser context,requires AI on the edge to perform liveness check of the face being captured by the webcam or connected camera. UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism.
        The security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and
        reverse engineering.
        2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or
        cryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated.
        To solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the
        browser context.
        The proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives.
        1 Model Security. The solution must provide a mechanism to protect the model from any reverse engineering or tampering.
        2 Model Size Optimisation. The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are
        expected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience.
        3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time
        task during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach. In the just-in-time approach, the model would be obfuscated or encrypted before being downloaded to the end user’s desktop.
        
        3. Expected Solution. The expected outcome of this project is a functional solution that incorporates the security of the ML model at the edge.

        innovative approach to implement face liveness using ML models which can be used in all forms of interfaces.
        2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to develop passive or active liveness detection models that can be used in the browser context to prevent the use of photo-of-photo, video or any form of face spoofing mechanism. Teams may opt for passive - which would the use environment to detect the liveness of the actor or active - which engages the aadhaar number holder for some “action” to detect the liveness.

As part of the challenge, participating teams to develop a solution, mostly following a passive approach through collection of environmental parameters and using AI/ML to analyze it in the backend to differentiate between bot and human-being. The passive solution may capture environmental details
        through the browser context and analyze the same with the help of ML models deployed in the backend. This solution, once accepted would be used by the UIDAI to protect all backend APIs from DoS/DDoS based vulnerabilities.

These devices/application come with vulnerabilities from time to time. There should be timely information sharing mechanism by which the concerned equipment users at critical sector orgs should be altered regarding any critical / high severity vulnerabilities in their equipment within the shortest possible time.
         Detailed description:
         The ICT components (HW/SW) being used by Critical Sector Organisations become vulnerable from time to time. These vulnerabilities can be categorised as Critical, High, Medium and Low. Any exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause havoc in multiple Critical Sector Organisations where such vulnerable equipment are being used.
         Keeping in view of the above, there is a need to monitor all such vulnerability information published at the equipment’s OEM websites and also other relevant websites. Once a critical or high severity vulnerability information is published at OEM website or any other relevant website, the ‘to be developed scrapper’ will immediately take that vulnerability input along with possible mitigating strategy published in the website and send the information to predefined email id(s).
         Note: The NVD website publishes such OEM vulnerable information. But the same comes with a time lag. It is therefore needed to get such information directly from OEM websites and /or from other relevant websites where such vulnerable information is published almost in real time.

        Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.
        The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.
        It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.
        Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.

                    <td>2.1 Background:
        2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.
        2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.
        2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.
        2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.
        2.2 Detailed Description:
        2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:
        i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.
        ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.
        iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.
        2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.
        2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).
        
        2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.
        2.3 Expected Solution:
        2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.
        2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services.
        2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.

                    <td>Background: Synthetically-generated audios and videos i.e. deep fakes are in trends nowadays. Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.
        Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: 
        i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. 
        ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. 
        iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. 
        iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. 
        v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. 
        vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. 
        vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. 
        viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. 
        ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. 
        Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation.</td>

In addition, one important requirement of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is that solution should be “offline and on-premise” and should be “updated with latest definition on regular basis”. Therefore, the reliable and effective solution can be developed by creating a pipeline combining multiple AV engines working parallelly offline. 
        Description: To develop a scanning pipeline in which the data residing in “Target Folder” will be scanned automatically by multiple antiviruses and accordingly the cleaned files will be in same folder and the infected files will be segregated and transferred in a specific folder i.e. “Infected Folders” with their analysis report. In addition, the path of each infected file will also be recorded in a separate doc file in same Infected folders.
        The functional block diagram is depicted below: 
        Target Folder -> Offline Parallel -> Infected Files
        One VM may be used for one AV which will be updated regularly (as per respective AV update policy) with latest definition of respective AV.

        The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. The water footprint helps us understand for what purposes our limited freshwater resources are being consumed. The impact of it depends on where the water is taken from and when, if it comes from a place where water is already scarce, the consequences can be significant and require action. 
        Detailed Description 
        The increase in the amount of non-available water due to pollution and scarce groundwater level has added more water footprints, at the community as well as at the personal levels. An increased 
        · water footprint directly affects the health and future of the citizens. Preventing severe drought in water-stressed areas is only going to be possible if water is used with more care and efficiency, this can be achieved if we have readily available data of water footprints. 
        Expected Solution 
        Hence, by using digital technologies like AI, Big Data, Block chain etc. and computer languages, a user friendly app or website may be developed which can provide the water footprints of different items/ final products we eat by feeding little inputs like name, or just by scanning through camera like Google lens. The app should support local languages; this will ensure the pan India usage and sensitize the people about water footprints of items they use in daily life.</td>

        The absence of a centralized knowledge-sharing platform like wikis significantly hampers the dissemination of water-efficient techniques, which could mitigate water scarcity. Despite the existence of various methods to conserve water, especially in agriculture, the lack of awareness and accessibility to this information perpetuates inefficient water use. This gap in knowledge sharing contributes to the overuse of water resources and exacerbates water stress, particularly in regions where agriculture is heavily dependent on irrigation. Establishing a comprehensive, accessible platform could catalyze the adoption of sustainable practices, crucial for addressing the global challenge of water scarcity. 
        Detailed Description: 
        A centralized knowledge-sharing platform akin to Wikis would facilitate the exchange of innovative methods, successful case studies, and research findings, fostering local and global collaboration. Without it, valuable insights remain siloed, hindering the adoption of practices that could conserve water resources and enhance sustainability. The creation of an accessible, comprehensive repository of water conservation strategies is thus critical for addressing the pressing challenge of water scarcity worldwide. 
        Expected Solution: 
        To address the lack of knowledge sharing platforms on water efficiency, creating a dedicated wiki-style database is the key. This platform would host peer-reviewed articles on water-saving techniques, community forums for sharing local knowledge, videos and interactive tools for calculating water usage and savings.

        Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. 
        Description 
        There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. 
        Expected Solution 
        There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.</td>

NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies.
        As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.
        Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological & hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.
        Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.
        The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.
        Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.
        a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.

        1. Article 243G of the Constitution of India acknowledges Panchayats as institutions of local self-government and mandates them to prepare plans for economic development and social justice. As local government, Gram Panchayats (GPs) are responsible for delivery of basic services to local citizens and address the vulnerabilities of poor and marginalized ones. This can only be achieved through implementation of well thought out
        plans through efficient and responsible utilization of available resources.
        2. An efficient and robust planning process as part of GP’s core functioning becomes necessary. GP development plan should ideally match people’s needs and priorities with the available resources. It should be prepared through a fair, inclusive, transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local development issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of problems and solutions, and local resources management all within a collective local vision.
        3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for effective implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National importance.
        The formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution.
        4. A need was felt to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile, i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part IX areas.
        Accordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating 17 SDGs into 9 broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) at grassroot level through Panchayats adopting ‘Whole of Government and Whole of Society Approach’ and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic approach to achieve localization for SDGs in rural India.

        Description
        Design a game for a Hackathon event that enhances participant engagement, fosters planning, and develops a better Panchayat/Village development
        The objective is to create a gamified experience that can help villagers/youth, etc. to prepare a village development plan. A simulated environment is needed to develop a self-sustained village development plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the
        
        village using the resources available. It is envisaged to develop ‘Farmville’ kind of a game for a village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input.
        Key Components to include for the game app:
        Budget Estimate: Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning.
        Work Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction, establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc.
        The basic steps of the Game broadly involve: -
        i. Select the village, where development plan is required by the villagers.
        ii. Based on the input received such as the village building footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing village for which development plan is required.
        iii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the village.
        iv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying of
        drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the villagers, etc.
        v. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats under different Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the development activity
        as in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats.
        vi. Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features.
        vii. Arrive at a tentative estimate for the planning being performed.
        viii. Ability to provide a walkthrough of the 3D platform.
        ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D platform.
        A few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: -
        Case1: Road laying activity
        
        • The player selects the start point and endpoint with intermediate points wherever required for road construction. It needs to validate that any road laying activity may not be a duplicate road construction plan.
        • The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of the road etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game. Based on
        changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road, it should be regenerated.
        • Once the road construction is done by the player, cost of construction should be auto generated.
        • Ability to measure the road dimensions and road shoulders.
        
        Case 2: Streetlight
        
        • The player selects the road where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game artefacts.
        • The player has option to check the light illumination based on the time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change – the changes to reflect on the game for best results.
        • Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street lighting to be generated.
        
        Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and width of each side.
        
        • The player selects the village for developmental activity.
        • The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected village.
        • The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create the dimension of the house along with roof type area.
        
        Expected Solution
        Panchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times, exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan to
        develop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat development plan activities.
        • A detailed game outlining the work model.
        • Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface.
        • Documentation on implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the gamification system into the Hackathon event.

        1. The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the SVAMITVA Scheme on the National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2020 with a resolve to enable the economic progress of Rural India by providing “Record of Rights” to every rural household owner. The scheme aims to demarcate inhabited (Abadi) land in rural areas through the latest surveying drone technology, Continuous Operating Reference System (CORS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning
        2. With the use latest drone technology and CORS technology for the Abadi land survey, the high resolution and accurate image base maps of 50 cm have facilitated creation of the most durable record of property holdings in these areas with no legacy revenue records. Such accurate image-based maps provide a clear demarcation of land holdings in a very short frame of time compared to on ground physical measurement and mapping of the land parcels.

                    <td>BACKGROUND: 
        In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.
        Problem Statement Details:
        “Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.”

        The proposed system will allow students to upload their required documents through a secure online portal. Upon submission, the documents will be automatically sent to the SAG Bureau for verification. Once verified, the SAG Bureau will forward the approved documents to the Finance Bureau for the release of payments. The system will ensure that the entire process, from document submission to scholarship disbursement, is conducted digitally, eliminating the need for any hard copy submissions.
        Key features of the system should include:
        • A user-friendly interface for students to upload and manage their documents.
        • Secure authentication and verification mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of the submitted documents.
        • An automated workflow to route the documents from the SAG Bureau to the Finance Bureau after verification.
        • Real-time tracking and notification system to keep students informed about the status of their submissions and payments.
        • Compliance with data privacy and security standards to protect the personal information of the students.
        Expected Solution:
        
        The expected solution is a comprehensive, fully digital system for the submission, verification, and disbursement of PMSSS scholarships. The solution should:
        • Enable students to upload their documents digitally and track their submission status.
        • Allow the SAG Bureau to verify the uploaded documents without the need for physical copies.
        • Facilitate the automatic forwarding of verified documents to the Finance Bureau for payment processing.
        • Ensure a seamless, paperless process that enhances efficiency, reduces processing time, and minimizes the risk of document loss or misplacement.</td>

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.

        ODD School Structure refers to schools that do not conform to the standard categories
        defined by the Ministry of Education under the UDISE+ portal. These standard categories are
        designed to align with the Samagra Shiksha framework, which aims to ensure uniformity
        and consistency in the educational structures across the country. Schools falling outside
        these categories, due to variations in grade configurations, are classified as having ""odd
        structures.""
        
        However, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the ""odd"" school structure category
        due to variations in grade configurations. These odd structures pose challenges for the
        uniform implementation of educational policies and schemes, such as Samagra Shiksha. This
        misalignment is particularly significant in states like Goa, Mizoram, West Bengal, and Kerala,
        where the majority of schools do not conform to the standard categories.
        
        Description:
        The problem of odd school structures affects the equitable distribution of resources,
        effective policy implementation, and the overall quality of education. Schools with odd
        structures are often excluded from the streamlined processes and benefits that come with
        standardization. The national average of schools with odd structures is 14.28%, but in some
        states, the percentage is much higher, complicating the delivery of educational initiatives.
        The objective is to standardize these odd school structures by aligning them with the
        defined categories under Samagra Shiksha, thereby improving the uniformity and
        effectiveness of educational policies across the country.
        
        Innovative Solutions:
        
        A. AI-Driven School Structure Analysis Tool: Develop software that uses AI to analyze
        school data and automatically classify schools into standard categories or identify
        them as odd structures. This tool can also suggest optimal restructuring options to
        align schools with the standard categories.
        B. Standardization Support Platform: Create a platform that provides guidelines, best
        practices, and resources for schools to transition from odd to standard structures.
        The platform could include modules on infrastructure planning, grade
        reconfiguration, and community engagement strategies.
        C. Dynamic Resource Allocation System: Develop a system that allows for flexible
        resource allocation based on school structures. This system would help in
        distributing resources more equitably by taking into account the specific needs of
        schools with odd structures during the transition period.
        D. Progress Monitoring Dashboard: Implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring
        the progress of schools as they transition from odd to standard structures. This
        dashboard would provide insights to policymakers and administrators, allowing them
        to track changes, identify bottlenecks, and intervene as necessary.
        E. Interactive Stakeholder Engagement Portal: Develop an online portal to engage with
        school administrators, teachers, and the community. This portal could include
        forums, feedback tools, and support resources to facilitate the transition to standard
        structures, ensuring that the process is inclusive and addresses local concerns.</td>

The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps –
        1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.
        2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input.
        3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis.
        Description:
        Fuzzing has proven its effectiveness in discovering thousands of vulnerabilities in file-processing and stateless applications. In fuzzing, and automated testing in general, designing test oracles is crucial.

        1. Target functions identified
        2. Live demonstration of fuzzing harness developed
        3. Code Coverage achieved
        4. Technical report submitted by the team.
        Expected Solution: Each team must provide a fuzzing harness that is capable of fuzzing the windows software solution of the Sumatra PDF Reader (version 3.5.2 or later). This fuzzing harness must identify target functions and supply appropriate arguments for the invocation of such functions. The fuzzing harness will be run using a fuzzer (preferably WinAFL).

                    <td>Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.
        Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.
        Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.
        Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.
        Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:
        1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.
        2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats.
        3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files.
        4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports.
        5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.</td>
